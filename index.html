         <h3>Your guide</h3>
            <p>"Awgu is marked by extensive hills especially in the western flank and lowland in the eastern side. These hills have steep slopes 
                and could attain an altitude of about 350–400 meters above sea level with mean slope angle of 15o and a modal class of 11o. Awgu is drained mainly by seasonal finger-like springs and streams. They dry up during the dry season (November- March) 
                and yield more water in the wet season (April to October). Most of the streams obtain their source from top of the hills and flow downhill". The major economic activity for majority of the population is subsistence farming and crops such as cassava, 
                yam, cocoyam, vegetables, maize, etc. are grown. Bush fallowing, mixed cropping and shifting cultivation are some of their farming practices. 
                Livestock rearing is also common among some of the people. Palm wine extraction and stone quarrying are other economic activities also undertaken in Awgu. Orie is our popular market.</p>
